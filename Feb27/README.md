# Weekend Week 1 Assignments
I have all the assignments to be run on Main.java in a switch case.

Please see the folowing for running instructions
# Lambda Choice

To run the the lambda switch choice program, run;

```
$ javac Main.java
```
then run ```java Main``` followed by the number of the choice and the number to be tested, such as the example below;

```
$  java Main 2 33
```
Then you will see the result of the choice output.

## User Story
* Have 3 methods that return booleans depending on what method is selected
* There will be a one method to check if input is an Odd number
* There will be a one method to check if input is a Prime number
* There will be a one method to check if input is an Palindrome
* The choice will be selected by the args[0] of the input and the num by args[1]

# Modulus

To run the Modulus program, first compile the program with;
```
javac Main.java
```
then to run the modulus program, ru;
```
java Main 10
```
and the program will run the test data, and output the results.

# DDouble the number

To run the DDouble program, first compile the program with;
```
javac Main.java
```
then run the DDouble program with;
```
java Main 22
```
Then the program will run the test data, and output the results.

# NoX

To run the NoX program, first compile the program with;
```
javac Main.java
```
then to run the modulus program, ru;
```
java Main x
```
and the program will run the test data, and output the results.

# Recursive sum clumping

To run the NoX program, first compile the program with;
```
javac Main.java
```
then to run the modulus program, run;
```
java Main isSum
```
and the program will run the test data, and output the results.

# tests

To run test cases, 1st make sure you have hamcrest and Junit intalled;

Then run the test cases in you IDE.
